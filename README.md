# fractalus-pkgbuild
The classic 1980's game Rescue on Fractalus remade for modern computers. This will become my own pkgbuild for Coopertronic OS.

#### To Do

- [ ] Find what is causing the folloing error when launching from the terminal. 
- `Loading in SingleInstance mode` 
  `Error opening /opt/fractalus/unity.lock: Permission denied`

- [ ] Desktop launcher is looking in opt for the game instead of running the bin launcher.
